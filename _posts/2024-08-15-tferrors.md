## Tcp error connection resolution
```shell
  sts.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com on 192.168.1.1:53: no such host
```
- [ ] Check for
  - [ ] Typos within your code.
  - [x] Probably your dns resolver

In my case it is the dns on my host machine.

### Fix
```shell
apt install resolvconf
systemctl start resolvconf 
systemctl enable resolvconf 
systemctl status resolvconf
echo "nameserver 1.1.1.1" >> /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head
resolvconf --enable-updates
resolvconf -u
```
